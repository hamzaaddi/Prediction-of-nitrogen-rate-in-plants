# Nitrogen Rate Prediction in Crops

This project aims to predict the nitrogen rate required for optimal crop growth using a combination of laboratory data and satellite data. The project utilizes various machine learning and deep learning models to develop accurate predictions. The following sections provide an overview of the project and its components.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to leverage lab data and satellite data to predict the nitrogen rate needed for optimal crop growth. The project involves several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training and evaluation.

## Data

The project utilizes two types of data:

1. Lab Data: This dataset contains information collected from laboratory experiments, including various parameters related to crop growth and nitrogen levels. It serves as the primary source of ground truth data.

2. Satellite Data: This dataset comprises satellite imagery data capturing different spectral bands and vegetation indices. It provides additional information about the crops' health and growth patterns.

Both datasets are merged and processed to create a comprehensive dataset for training and testing the models.

## Workflow

The project follows the following workflow:

1. Data Preprocessing: In this step, the lab data and satellite data are cleaned, transformed, and merged to create a unified dataset. Missing values are handled, outliers are addressed, and the data is prepared for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA techniques are applied to gain insights into the data. Statistical analysis, visualizations, and correlation studies are performed to understand the relationships between different variables and identify key features.

3. Feature Engineering: Relevant features are extracted or created from the available datasets. This step involves domain knowledge, feature selection techniques, and transformations to enhance the predictive power of the models.

4. Model Selection and Training: Various machine learning and deep learning models are implemented and trained on the preprocessed data. This includes traditional regression models, ensemble methods, and neural network architectures.

5. Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or R-squared. Model performance is analyzed, and the best-performing models are selected.

6. Model Deployment: The selected model(s) are deployed to make predictions on new, unseen data. The deployment process may involve creating an API, building a web interface, or integrating the model into existing systems.

## Dependencies

The project has the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.
